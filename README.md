Onboarding Screens (First-time Use Only)

When a user launches the app for the first time, they are introduced to the app's functionalities through a series of onboarding screens.
These screens are displayed only once, providing a walkthrough of the app's main features.
Account Creation

Users can create a personal account by providing their name, email, and a secure password.
Password requirements:
Minimum 6 characters.
At least one capital letter.
At least one lowercase letter.
At least one special character (e.g., $, %, ^).
This process ensures secure access to the app.
Profile Completion

Users must complete their profile by adding their country and Date of Birth (DOB) after account creation.
This is a required step before gaining full access to the app's features.
Login

Users can log in to the app using their credentials (email and password).
Upon successful login, users gain access to their account details and transaction features.
View Account Balance

Users can view their current account balance within the app to monitor their available funds.
Transaction History

Users can view a detailed history of their transactions.
The history includes key details such as the transaction date, recipient name, and transaction amount.
Send Money

Users can securely send money by entering the recipient's name and account number.
This feature allows for quick and secure money transfers between users.
API-based Recipient Verification

Before confirming a money transfer, the app verifies the recipientâ€™s account details (name and account number) via an API call.
This ensures that the user is transferring funds to the correct recipient.
Transaction Confirmation and Notification

After successfully completing a transaction, users receive a confirmation or notification to confirm that the transaction was processed correctly.
Error Notifications

In case of any transaction errors (e.g., insufficient funds, invalid recipient details), users receive appropriate error messages to guide them on the necessary actions to rectify the issue.
Profile Updates

Users can update their profile information, such as email address, country, DOB, or password, at any time to keep their account secure and up to date.
Customer Support Options

If users encounter issues within the app, they have two options for assistance:
Call customer support.
Send an email to customer support.
Session Timeout Alert

If a user is inactive for two minutes (no requests sent/received from the server), they receive an alert dialog.
The alert prompts the user to log in again to continue using the app securely.
Favorites Management (Optional)

Users can save one or more recipients to a favorites list for quicker future transfers.
Users can also edit or delete recipients from the favorites list.
Error Screens (Optional)

The app includes specified error screens to handle situations like server errors or lack of internet connection.
